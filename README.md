# strong-skel
A research implementation of RS-S and RS-WS from Minden et al., "A recursive skeletonization factorization based on strong admissibility".

Built on the [FLAM library](https://github.com/klho/FLAM/) by Ken L. Ho, this research code implements the factorizations described in "A recursive skeletonization factorization based on strong admissibility" by Minden et al., available at [arXiv:1609.08130](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08130).

Tests are available as MATLAB functions in the directory "test" and may be run with no arguments, assuming that FLAM and the root directory are in your MATLAB path.
